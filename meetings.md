# Meeting 2

TO-DO List:

- A:
  - Better structure for shapeNet -> Like ModelNet implementation
    - at least give stats
      - time needed
      - space needed

# Meeting 3
Ingo: mostly training:
- resnet18 deep
- efficientnet deep
- convnext deep for feature extraction
Ronald:
- get our architecture to work with 'original' datasets
- test on shapenet55 with lower epochs
- test different architectures outside of extraction
Askar:
- combine dataset
- get generation script working
- pitch new architectures outside of extraction
